The project "SUTURO - sudo tidy up my room" was a project for master students at the University of Bremen. Our goal was to develop a café using several robots, like [Alderbaran's Pepper](https://www.ald.softbankrobotics.com/en/robots/pepper) or [Willow Garage's PR2](http://www.willowgarage.com/pages/pr2/overview).  

The group was split into the subgroups Knowledge, Manipulation, Perception and Planning. During the one-year project, I lead the Knowledge team, that concentrated on creating a knowledge representation and reasoning systems using the [KnowRob](http://knowrob.org/) framework and using the robot Pepper as a guide for [openEASE](https://www.open-ease.org/) ([video](https://youtu.be/GJxIQlPYL0A))
